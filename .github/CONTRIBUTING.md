## Development and Testing

The project depends on Swift. You can follow the [Getting Started](https://swift.org/getting-started/) guide to get it installed.

To develop and debug the project locally, clone the repository, and then create a Xcode project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-ios.git
cd amadeus-ios
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

The command will create a new `Amadeus.xcodeproj` folder. You can open the project to develop and debug from Xcode IDE

```sh
open Amadeus.xcodeproj
```
### Running tests

Some tests depend on your Amadeus for Developers API credentials. Make sure your credentials are exported as environment varibles before opening Xcode:

```sh
export AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID="amadeusclientid"
export AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET="amadeusclientsecret"

open Amadeus.xcodeproj
```

Tests can be run either in Xcode or in the console:

```sh
swift test
```

If you want to run a specific test suite, you can pass the `filter` parameter:

```sh
swift test --filter CoreTests
```
